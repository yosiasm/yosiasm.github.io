Hi!👋 I'm **Yosias Suparno** and I currently work in the field of data. I *design database schemas* for some of my company's products. I *classify* large amounts of documents by *training models* to *automate repetitive tasks*. Additionally, I *optimize data pipelines* for clients by *designing and building ETL pipelines* to ensure they run efficiently. I *lead* a small team of data scientists, many of whom are fresh graduates, and I *help* them to succeed in this field. I *explore and analyze data* from our clients and sometimes randomly *scrape data* from the internet. I am also responsible for *visualizing* some of our POC projects. I spend a lot of my time *researching new technologies* that can *help my company* reduce manual labor.
